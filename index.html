            Shedletsky is one of the characters in Forsaken. He is a sentinel Survivor and the first free sentinel available to all players.
            He uses two iconic tools: his sword that stuns Killers for a few seconds, and a fried chicken leg (actually a turkey leg) that grants Regeneration.

            Guest666 is feared for his Blood Hunt ability, turning matches into genuine horror. He applies pressure with darkness, intimidation,
